The main program is located inside blackjack.py
To play blackjack: "python3 blackjack.py"
To run test suite: "python3 tests.py"

The goal of this project is to take preexisting code and to
create an automated testing and deployment environment for it.

This program is a blackjack game that is played inside the terminal console.
The tests already included were minimal, and the goal is to achieve 75% test coverage.
This may not be 100% realistic due to the amount of I/O that is used, but
anything that can be tested, will be tested.

After that I am going to set up an automated testing and build environment through Jenkins.
The final thing is to create a docker container for my application so that i can easily distribute it.
